# Instagram-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes Instagram data to gain insights into user engagement patterns, hashtag trends, and follower dynamics. The analysis was conducted using SQL for querying and Power BI for data visualization.

# Project Objectives
To analyze engagement patterns across various post types and hashtags.
To identify popular hashtags and their impact on likes and comments.
To evaluate the follower-to-following ratios to identify influential users.
To understand user interaction through different types of engagements (likes, comments, shares).

# Dataset Information
The dataset consists of three tables that capture Instagram profiles, posts, and user engagement.
User Profiles: Contains data about users, including user_id, username, followers, following, total_posts, and bio.
Instagram Posts: Contains data on individual posts, such as post_id, post_date, likes, comments, shares, reach, impressions, saves, and hashtags.
User Engagements: Captures engagement interactions, including engagement_id, post_id, user_id, engagement_type, and engagement_date.

# SQL Queries and Insights
Several SQL queries were used to extract insights from the data. Here are some of the main queries:
Most Popular Hashtags: Identifies hashtags that receive the highest average likes and comments.
Average Likes and Comments Per Hashtag: Calculates average likes and comments for each hashtag to assess engagement.
Follower-to-Following Ratio: Computes the ratio to identify influential users with a high following relative to those they follow.
Most Active Users: Highlights users with the highest engagement counts.

# Technologies Used
SQL: For data querying and analysis.
Power BI: For data visualization.
GitHub: For version control and project sharing.
